Module duplication leads to inevitable runtime\n\t * errors.\n\t *\n\t * There are many situations in which some modules can be loaded twice. In the worst case scenario,\n\t * you may need to check your project for each of these issues and fix them all.\n\t *\n\t * # Trying to add a plugin to an existing build\n\t *\n\t * If you import an existing CKEditor 5 build and a plugin like this:\n\t *\n\t *\t\timport ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic';\n\t *\t\timport Highlight from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-highlight/src/highlight';\n\t *\n\t * Then your project loads some CKEditor 5 packages twice. How does it happen?\n\t *\n\t * The build package contains a file which is already compiled with webpack. This means\n\t * that it contains all the necessary code from e.g. `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine` and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils`.\n\t *\n\t * However, the `Highlight` plugin imports some of the modules from these packages, too. If you ask webpack to\n\t * build such a project, you will end up with the modules being included (and run) twice &mdash; first, because they are\n\t * included inside the build package, and second, because they are required by the `Highlight` plugin.\n\t *\n\t * Therefore, **you must never add plugins to an existing build** unless your plugin has no dependencies.\n\t *\n\t * Adding plugins to a build is done by taking the source version of this build (so, before it was built with webpack)\n\t * and adding plugins there. In this situation, webpack will know that it only needs to load each plugin once.\n\t *\n\t * Read more in the {@glink builds/guides/integration/installing-plugins \"Installing plugins\"} guide.\n\t *\n\t * # Confused an editor build with an editor implementation\n\t *\n\t * This scenario is very similar to the previous one, but has a different origin.\n\t *\n\t * Let's assume that you wanted to use CKEditor 5 from source, as explained in the\n\t * {@glink builds/guides/integration/advanced-setup#scenario-2-building-from-source \"Building from source\"} section\n\t * or in the {@glink framework/guides/quick-start \"Quick start\"} guide of CKEditor 5 Framework.\n\t *\n\t * The correct way to do so is to import an editor and plugins and run them together like this:\n\t *\n\t *\t\timport ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic/src/classiceditor';\n\t *\t\timport Essentials from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-essentials/src/essentials';\n\t *\t\timport Paragraph from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paragraph/src/paragraph';\n\t *\t\timport Bold from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/bold';\n\t *\t\timport Italic from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/italic';\n\t *\n\t *\t\tClassicEditor\n\t *\t\t\t.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {\n\t *\t\t\t\tplugins: [ Essentials, Paragraph, Bold, Italic ],\n\t *\t\t\t\ttoolbar: [ 'bold', 'italic' ]\n\t *\t\t\t} )\n\t *\t\t\t.then( editor => {\n\t *\t\t\t\tconsole.log( 'Editor was initialized', editor );\n\t *\t\t\t} )\n\t *\t\t\t.catch( error => {\n\t *\t\t\t\tconsole.error( error.stack );\n\t *\t\t\t} );\n\t *\n\t * However, you might have mistakenly imported a build instead of the source `ClassicEditor`. In this case\n\t * your imports will look like this:\n\t *\n\t *\t\timport ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic';\n\t *\t\timport Essentials from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-essentials/src/essentials';\n\t *\t\timport Paragraph from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paragraph/src/paragraph';\n\t *\t\timport Bold from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/bold';\n\t *\t\timport Italic from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/italic';\n\t *\n\t * This creates the same situation as in the previous section because you use a build together with source plugins.\n\t *\n\t * Remember: `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-*` packages contain editor builds and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-*` contain source editors.\n\t *\n\t * # Loading two or more builds on one page\n\t *\n\t * If you use CKEditor 5 builds, you might have loaded two (or more) `ckeditor.js` files on one web page.\n\t * Check your web page for duplicated `<script>` elements or make sure your page builder/bundler includes CKEditor only once.\n\t *\n\t * If you want to use two different types of editors at once, see the\n\t * {@glink builds/guides/integration/advanced-setup#scenario-3-using-two-different-editors \"Using two different editors\"}\n\t * section.\n\t *\n\t * # Using outdated packages\n\t *\n\t * Building CKEditor 5 from source requires using multiple npm packages. These packages have their dependencies\n\t * to other packages. If you use the latest version of, for example, `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic` with\n\t * an outdated version of `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image`, npm or yarn will need to install two different versions of\n\t * `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core` because `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic` and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image` may require\n\t * different versions of the core package.\n\t *\n\t * The solution to this issue is to update all packages to their latest version. We recommend\n\t * using tools like [`npm-check-updates`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) which simplify this process.\n\t *\n\t * # Conflicting version of dependencies\n\t *\n\t * This is a special case of the previous scenario. If you use CKEditor 5 with some third-party plugins,\n\t * it may happen that even if you use the latest versions of the official packages and the latest version of\n\t * these third-party packages, there will be a conflict between some of their dependencies.\n\t *\n\t * Such a problem can be resolved by either downgrading CKEditor 5 packages (which we do not recommend) or\n\t * asking the author of the third-party package to upgrade its depdendencies (or forking their project and doing this yourself).\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** All official CKEditor 5 packages (excluding integrations and `ckeditor5-dev-*` packages) are released in the\n\t * same major version. This is &mdash; in the `x.y.z`, the `x` is the same for all packages. This is the simplest way to check\n\t * whether you use packages coming from the same CKEditor 5 version. You can read more about versioning in the\n\t * {@glink framework/guides/support/versioning-policy Versioning policy} guide.\n\t *\n\t * # Packages were duplicated in `node_modules`\n\t *\n\t * In some situations, especially when calling `npm install` multiple times, it may happen\n\t * that npm will not correctly \"deduplicate\" packages.\n\t *\n\t * Normally, npm deduplicates all packages so, for example, `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core` is installed only once in `node_modules/`.\n\t * However, it is known to fail to do so from time to time.\n\t *\n\t * We recommend checking if any of the steps listed below help:\n\t *\n\t * * `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` to make sure you have a clean `node_modules/` directory. This step\n\t * is known to help in most cases.\n\t * * If you use `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`, remove it before `npm install`.\n\t * * Check whether all CKEditor 5 packages are up to date and reinstall them\n\t * if you changed anything (`rm -rf node_modules && npm install`).\n\t *\n\t * If all packages are correct and compatible with each other, the steps above are known to help. If not, you may\n\t * try to check with `npm ls` how many times packages like `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core`, `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine` and\n\t *`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils` are installed. If more than once, verify which package causes that.\n\t *\n\t * @error ckeditor-duplicated-modules\n\t */\n\tthrow new CKEditorError(\n\t\t'ckeditor-duplicated-modules',\n\t\tnull\n\t);\n} else {\n\twindowOrGlobal.CKEDITOR_VERSION = version;\n}\n","/** Detect free variable `global` from Node.js. */\nvar freeGlobal = typeof global == 'object' && global && global.Object === Object && global;\n\nexport default freeGlobal;\n","import root from './_root.js';\n\n/** Detect free variable `exports`. */\nvar freeExports = typeof exports == 'object' && exports && !exports.nodeType && exports;\n\n/** Detect free variable `module`. */\nvar freeModule = freeExports && typeof module == 'object' && module && !module.nodeType && module;\n\n/** Detect the popular CommonJS extension `module.exports`. */\nvar moduleExports = freeModule && freeModule.exports === freeExports;\n\n/** Built-in value references. */\nvar Buffer = moduleExports ? root.Buffer : undefined,\n    allocUnsafe = Buffer ?

Because of it, we need to fill all\n * empty elements which should be selectable with elements or characters called \"fillers\". Unfortunately there is no one\n * universal filler, this is why two types are uses:\n *\n * * Block filler is an element which fill block elements, like `<p>`. CKEditor uses `<br>` as a block filler during the editing,\n * as browsers do natively. So instead of an empty `<p>` there will be `<p><br></p>`. The advantage of block filler is that\n * it is transparent for the selection, so when the caret is before the `<br>` and user presses right arrow he will be\n * moved to the next paragraph, not after the `<br>`. The disadvantage is that it breaks a block, so it can not be used\n * in the middle of a line of text. The {@link module:engine/view/filler~BR_FILLER `<br>` filler} can be replaced with any other\n * character in the data output, for instance {@link module:engine/view/filler~NBSP_FILLER non-breaking space} or\n * {@link module:engine/view/filler~MARKED_NBSP_FILLER marked non-breaking space}.\n *\n * * Inline filler is a filler which does not break a line of text, so it can be used inside the text, for instance in the empty\n * `<b>` surrendered by text: `foo<b></b>bar`, if we want to put the caret there. CKEditor uses a sequence of the zero-width\n * spaces as an {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER inline filler} having the predetermined\n * {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER_LENGTH length}. A sequence is used, instead of a single character to\n * avoid treating random zero-width spaces as the inline filler. Disadvantage of the inline filler is that it is not\n * transparent for the selection. The arrow key moves the caret between zero-width spaces characters, so the additional\n * code is needed to handle the caret.\n *\n * Both inline and block fillers are handled by the {@link module:engine/view/renderer~Renderer renderer} and are not present in the\n * view.\n *\n * @module engine/view/filler\n */\n\n/**\n * Non-breaking space filler creator.

Callbacks listening to these events are called converters. The\n * converters' role is to convert the model changes to changes in view (for example, adding view nodes or\n * changing attributes on view elements).\n *\n * During the conversion process, downcast dispatcher fires events basing on the state of the model and prepares\n * data for these events. It is important to understand that the events are connected with the changes done on the model,\n * for example: \"a node has been inserted\" or \"an attribute has changed\". This is in contrary to upcasting (a view-to-model conversion)\n * where you convert the view state (view nodes) to a model tree.\n *\n * The events are prepared basing on a diff created by {@link module:engine/model/differ~Differ Differ}, which buffers them\n * and then passes to the downcast dispatcher as a diff between the old model state and the new model state.\n *\n * Note that because the changes are converted, there is a need to have a mapping between the model structure and the view structure.\n * To map positions and elements during the downcast (a model-to-view conversion), use {@link module:engine/conversion/mapper~Mapper}.\n *\n * Downcast dispatcher fires the following events for model tree changes:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:insert `insert`} &ndash;\n * If a range of nodes was inserted to the model tree.\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:remove `remove`} &ndash;\n * If a range of nodes was removed from the model tree.\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute `attribute`} &ndash;\n * If an attribute was added, changed or removed from a model node.\n *\n * For {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:insert `insert`}\n * and {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute `attribute`},\n * downcast dispatcher generates {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable consumables}.\n * These are used to have control over which changes have already been consumed. It is useful when some converters\n * overwrite others or convert multiple changes (for example, it converts an insertion of an element and also converts that\n * element's attributes during the insertion).\n *\n * Additionally, downcast dispatcher fires events for {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~Marker marker} changes:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:addMarker} &ndash; If a marker was added.\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:removeMarker} &ndash; If a marker was removed.\n *\n * Note that changing a marker is done through removing the marker from the old range and adding it to the new range,\n * so both events are fired.\n *\n * Finally, downcast dispatcher also handles firing events for the {@link module:engine/model/selection model selection}\n * conversion:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:selection}\n * &ndash; Converts the selection from the model to the view.\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute}\n * &ndash; Fired for every selection attribute.\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:addMarker}\n * &ndash; Fired for every marker that contains a selection.\n *\n * Unlike the model tree and the markers, the events for selection are not fired for changes but for a selection state.\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for a downcast dispatcher, remember to check whether a given change has not been\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#consume consumed} yet.\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for downcast dispatcher, keep in mind that any callback that has\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#consume consumed} a value from a consumable and\n * converted the change should also stop the event (for efficiency purposes).\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for downcast dispatcher, remember to use the provided\n * {@link module:engine/view/downcastwriter~DowncastWriter view downcast writer} to apply changes to the view document.\n *\n * You can read more about conversion in the following guides:\n *\n * * {@glink framework/guides/deep-dive/conversion/conversion-introduction Advanced conversion concepts &mdash;

For example: `comment:e34zfk9k2n459df53sjl34:zx32c`.\n\t * The default configuration for this conversion is that the first part is the `group` part and the rest of\n\t * the marker name becomes the `name` part.\n\t *\n\t * Tag and attribute names and values are generated from the marker name:\n\t *\n\t * * The templates for attributes are `data-[group]-start-before=\"[name]\"`, `data-[group]-start-after=\"[name]\"`,\n\t * `data-[group]-end-before=\"[name]\"` and `data-[group]-end-after=\"[name]\"`.\n\t * * The templates for view elements are `<[group]-start name=\"[name]\">` and `<[group]-end name=\"[name]\">`.\n\t *\n\t * Attributes mark whether the given marker's start or end boundary is before or after the given element.\n\t * The `data-[group]-start-before` and `data-[group]-end-after` attributes are favored.\n\t * The other two are used when the former two cannot be used.\n\t *\n\t * The conversion configuration can take a function that will generate different group and name parts.\n\t * If such a function is set as the `config.view` parameter, it is passed a marker name and it is expected to return an object with two\n\t * properties: `group` and `name`. If the function returns a falsy value, the conversion will not take place.\n\t *\n\t * Basic usage:\n\t *\n\t *\t\t// Using the default conversion.\n\t *\t\t// In this case, all markers with names starting with 'comment:' will be converted.\n\t *\t\t// The `group` parameter will be set to `comment`.\n\t *\t\t// The `name` parameter will be the rest of the marker name (without the `:`).\n\t *\t\teditor.conversion.for( 'dataDowncast' ).markerToData( {\n\t *\t\t\tmodel: 'comment'\n\t *\t\t} );\n\t *\n\t * An example of a view that may be generated by this conversion (assuming a marker with the name `comment:commentId:uid` marked\n\t * by `[]`):\n\t *\n\t *\t\t// Model:\n\t *\t\t<paragraph>Foo[bar</paragraph>\n\t *\t\t<imageBlock src=\"abc.jpg\"></imageBlock>]\n\t *\n\t *\t\t// View:\n\t *\t\t<p>Foo<comment-start name=\"commentId:uid\"></comment-start>bar</p>\n\t *\t\t<figure data-comment-end-after=\"commentId:uid\" class=\"image\"><img src=\"abc.jpg\" /></figure>\n\t *\n\t * In the example above, the comment starts before \"bar\" and ends after the image.\n\t *\n\t * If the `name` part is empty, the following view may be generated:\n\t *\n\t *\t\t<p>Foo <myMarker-start></myMarker-start>bar</p>\n\t *\t\t<figure data-myMarker-end-after=\"\" class=\"image\"><img src=\"abc.jpg\" /></figure>\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** A situation where some markers have the `name` part and some do not, is incorrect and should be avoided.\n\t *\n\t * Examples where `data-group-start-after` and `data-group-end-before` are used:\n\t *\n\t *\t\t// Model:\n\t *\t\t<blockQuote>[]<paragraph>Foo</paragraph></blockQuote>\n\t *\n\t * \t\t// View:\n\t *\t\t<blockquote><p data-group-end-before=\"name\" data-group-start-before=\"name\">Foo</p></blockquote>\n\t *\n\t * Similarly, when a marker is collapsed after the last element:\n\t *\n\t *\t\t// Model:\n\t *\t\t<blockQuote><paragraph>Foo</paragraph>[]</blockQuote>\n\t *\n\t *\t\t// View:\n\t *\t\t<blockquote><p data-group-end-after=\"name\" data-group-start-after=\"name\">Foo</p></blockquote>\n\t *\n\t * When there are multiple markers from the same group stored in the same attribute of the same element, their\n\t * name parts are put together in the attribute value, for example: `data-group-start-before=\"name1,name2,name3\"`.\n\t *\n\t * Other examples of usage:\n\t *\n\t *\t\t//

Examples of selectable elements: `imageBlock`, `table`, `tableCell`,\n * etc.\n *\n * **Note:** An object is also a selectable element, so\n * {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#isSelectable `isSelectable()`} returns `true` for object elements automatically.\n *\n * Read more about selectable elements in the\n * {@glink framework/guides/deep-dive/schema#selectable-elements Selectable elements section} of\n * the {@glink framework/guides/deep-dive/schema Schema deep dive} guide.\n *\n * @property {Boolean} isContent\n * An item is a content when it always finds its way to the editor data output regardless of the number and type of its descendants.\n * Examples of content elements: `$text`, `imageBlock`, `table`, etc. (but not `paragraph`, `heading1` or `tableCell`).\n *\n * **Note:** An object is also a content element, so\n * {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#isContent `isContent()`} returns `true` for object elements automatically.\n *\n * Read more about content elements in the\n * {@glink framework/guides/deep-dive/schema#content-elements Content elements section} of\n * the {@glink framework/guides/deep-dive/schema Schema deep dive} guide.\n */\n\n/**\n * A simplified version of {@link module:engine/model/schema~SchemaItemDefinition} after\n * compilation by the {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema schema}.\n * Rules fed to the schema by {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#register}\n * and {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#extend} methods are defined in the\n * {@link module:engine/model/schema~SchemaItemDefinition} format.\n * Later on, they are compiled to `SchemaCompiledItemDefinition` so when you use e.g.\n * the {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#getDefinition} method you get the compiled version.\n *\n * The compiled version contains only the following properties:\n *\n * * The `name` property,\n * * The `is*` properties,\n * * The `allowIn` array,\n * * The `allowChildren` array,\n * * The `allowAttributes` array.\n *\n * @typedef {Object} module:engine/model/schema~SchemaCompiledItemDefinition\n */\n\n/**\n * A schema context &mdash; a list of ancestors of a given position in the document.\n *\n * Considering such position:\n *\n *\t\t<$root>\n *\t\t\t<blockQuote>\n *\t\t\t\t<paragraph>\n *\t\t\t\t\t^\n *\t\t\t\t</paragraph>\n *\t\t\t</blockQuote>\n *\t\t</$root>\n *\n * The context of this position is its {@link module:engine/model/position~Position#getAncestors lists of ancestors}:\n *\n *\t\t[ rootElement, blockQuoteElement, paragraphElement ]\n *\n * Contexts are used in the {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#event:checkChild `Schema#checkChild`} and\n * {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#event:checkAttribute `Schema#checkAttribute`} events as a definition\n * of a place in the document where the check occurs.

In contrary to {@link module:engine/model/node~Node nodes}, which are building blocks of\n * model document tree, markers are not stored directly in document tree but in\n * {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#markers model markers' collection}. Still, they are document data, by giving\n * additional meaning to the part of a model document between marker start and marker end.\n *\n * In this sense, markers are similar to adding and converting attributes on nodes. The difference is that attribute is\n * connected with a given node (e.g. a character is bold no matter if it gets moved or content around it changes).\n * Markers on the other hand are continuous ranges and are characterized by their start and end position. This means that\n * any character in the marker is marked by the marker. For example, if a character is moved outside of marker it stops being\n * \"special\" and the marker is shrunk. Similarly, when a character is moved into the marker from other place in document\n * model, it starts being \"special\" and the marker is enlarged.\n *\n * Another upside of markers is that finding marked part of document is fast and easy. Using attributes to mark some nodes\n * and then trying to find that part of document would require traversing whole document tree. Marker gives instant access\n * to the range which it is marking at the moment.\n *\n * Markers are built from a name and a range.\n *\n * Range of the marker is updated automatically when document changes, using\n * {@link module:engine/model/liverange~LiveRange live range} mechanism.\n *\n * Name is used to group and identify markers. Names have to be unique, but markers can be grouped by\n * using common prefixes, separated with `:`, for example: `user:john` or `search:3`. That's useful in term of creating\n * namespaces for custom elements (e.g. comments, highlights). You can use this prefixes in\n * {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection#event:update} listeners to listen on changes in a group of markers.\n * For instance: `model.markers.on( 'update:user', callback );` will be called whenever any `user:*` markers changes.\n *\n * There are two types of markers.\n *\n * 1. Markers managed directly, without using operations. They are added directly by {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer}\n * to the {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection} without any additional mechanism.

Currently, the supported modifications are:\n *\n * * Extending. The selection focus is moved in the specified `options.direction` with a step specified in `options.unit`.\n * Possible values for `unit` are:\n *  * `'character'` (default) - moves selection by one user-perceived character. In most cases this means moving by one\n *  character in `String` sense. However, unicode also defines \"combing marks\". These are special symbols, that combines\n *  with a symbol before it (\"base character\") to create one user-perceived character. For example, `q̣̇` is a normal\n *  letter `q` with two \"combining marks\": upper dot (`Ux0307`) and lower dot (`Ux0323`). For most actions, i.e. extending\n *  selection by one position, it is correct to include both \"base character\" and all of it's \"combining marks\". That is\n *  why `'character'` value is most natural and common method of modifying selection.\n *  * `'codePoint'` - moves selection by one unicode code point. In contrary to, `'character'` unit, this will insert\n *  selection between \"base character\" and \"combining mark\", because \"combining marks\" have their own unicode code points.\n *  However, for technical reasons, unicode code points with values above `UxFFFF` are represented in native `String` by\n *  two characters, called \"surrogate pairs\". Halves of \"surrogate pairs\" have a meaning only when placed next to each other.\n *  For example `𨭎` is represented in `String` by `\\uD862\\uDF4E`. Both `\\uD862` and `\\uDF4E` do not have any meaning\n *  outside the pair (are rendered as ? when alone). Position between them would be incorrect. In this case, selection\n *  extension will include whole \"surrogate pair\".\n *  * `'word'` - moves selection by a whole word.\n *\n * **Note:** if you extend a forward selection in a backward direction you will in fact shrink it.\n *\n * **Note:** Use {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#modifySelection} instead of this function.\n * This function is only exposed to be reusable in algorithms\n * which change the {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#modifySelection}\n * method's behavior.\n *\n * @param {module:engine/model/model~Model} model The model in context of which\n * the selection modification should be performed.\n * @param {module:engine/model/selection~Selection|module:engine/model/documentselection~DocumentSelection} selection\n * The selection to modify.\n * @param {Object} [options]\n * @param {'forward'|'backward'} [options.direction='forward'] The direction in which the selection should be modified.\n * @param {'character'|'codePoint'|'word'} [options.unit='character'] The unit by which selection should be modified.\n */\nexport default function modifySelection( model, selection, options = {} ) {\n\tconst schema = model.schema;\n\tconst isForward = options.direction != 'backward';\n\tconst unit = options.unit ? options.unit : 'character';\n\n\tconst focus = selection.focus;\n\n\tconst walker = new TreeWalker( {\n\t\tboundaries: getSearchRange( focus, isForward ),\n\t\tsingleCharacters: true,\n\t\tdirection: isForward ?

Currently, the supported modifications are:\n\t *\n\t * * Extending. The selection focus is moved in the specified `options.direction` with a step specified in `options.unit`.\n\t * Possible values for `unit` are:\n\t *  * `'character'` (default) - moves selection by one user-perceived character. In most cases this means moving by one\n\t *  character in `String` sense. However, unicode also defines \"combing marks\". These are special symbols, that combines\n\t *  with a symbol before it (\"base character\") to create one user-perceived character. For example, `q̣̇` is a normal\n\t *  letter `q` with two \"combining marks\": upper dot (`Ux0307`) and lower dot (`Ux0323`). For most actions, i.e. extending\n\t *  selection by one position, it is correct to include both \"base character\" and all of it's \"combining marks\". That is\n\t *  why `'character'` value is most natural and common method of modifying selection.\n\t *  * `'codePoint'` - moves selection by one unicode code point. In contrary to, `'character'` unit, this will insert\n\t *  selection between \"base character\" and \"combining mark\", because \"combining marks\" have their own unicode code points.\n\t *  However, for technical reasons, unicode code points with values above `UxFFFF` are represented in native `String` by\n\t *  two characters, called \"surrogate pairs\". Halves of \"surrogate pairs\" have a meaning only when placed next to each other.\n\t *  For example `𨭎` is represented in `String` by `\\uD862\\uDF4E`. Both `\\uD862` and `\\uDF4E` do not have any meaning\n\t *  outside the pair (are rendered as ? when alone). Position between them would be incorrect. In this case, selection\n\t *  extension will include whole \"surrogate pair\".\n\t *  * `'word'` - moves selection by a whole word.\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** if you extend a forward selection in a backward direction you will in fact shrink it.\n\t *\n\t * @fires modifySelection\n\t * @param {module:engine/model/selection~Selection|module:engine/model/documentselection~DocumentSelection} selection\n\t * The selection to modify.\n\t * @param {Object} [options]\n\t * @param {'forward'|'backward'} [options.direction='forward'] The direction in which the selection should be modified.\n\t * @param {'character'|'codePoint'|'word'} [options.unit='character'] The unit by which selection should be modified.\n\t */\n\tmodifySelection( selection, options ) {\n\t\tmodifySelection( this, selection, options );\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Gets a clone of the selected content.\n\t *\n\t * For example, for the following selection:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <paragraph>x</paragraph>\n\t * <blockQuote>\n\t *\t<paragraph>y</paragraph>\n\t *\t<heading1>fir[st</heading1>\n\t * </blockQuote>\n\t * <paragraph>se]cond</paragraph>\n\t * <paragraph>z</paragraph>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * It will return a document fragment with such a content:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <blockQuote>\n\t *\t<heading1>st</heading1>\n\t * </blockQuote>\n\t * <paragraph>se</paragraph>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * @fires getSelectedContent\n\t * @param {module:engine/model/selection~Selection|module:engine/model/documentselection~DocumentSelection} selection\n\t * The selection of which content will be returned.\n\t * @returns {module:engine/model/documentfragment~DocumentFragment}\n\t */\n\tgetSelectedContent( selection ) {\n\t\treturn getSelectedContent( this, selection );\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Checks whether the given {@link module:engine/model/range~Range range} or\n\t * {@link module:engine/model/element~Element element} has any meaningful content.\n\t *\n\t * Meaningful content is:\n\t *\n\t * * any text node (`options.ignoreWhitespaces` allows controlling whether this text node must also contain\n\t * any non-whitespace characters),\n\t * * or any {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#isContent content element},\n\t * * or any {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~Marker marker} which\n\t * {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~Marker#_affectsData affects data}.\n\t *\n\t * This means that a range containing an empty `<paragraph></paragraph>` is not considered to have a meaningful content.\n\t * However, a range containing an `<imageBlock></imageBlock>` (which would normally be marked in the schema as an object element)\n\t * is considered non-empty.\n\t *\n\t * @param {module:engine/model/range~Range|module:engine/model/element~Element} rangeOrElement Range or element to check.\n\t * @param {Object} [options]\n\t * @param {Boolean} [options.ignoreWhitespaces] Whether text node with whitespaces only should be considered empty.\n\t * @param {Boolean} [options.ignoreMarkers] Whether markers should be ignored.\n\t * @returns {Boolean}\n\t */\n\thasContent( rangeOrElement, options = {} ) {\n\t\tconst range = rangeOrElement instanceof ModelElement ?

When the visible view is removed from the stack,\n * the previous view becomes visible.\n *\n * It might be useful to implement nested navigation in a balloon. For instance, a toolbar view may contain a link button.\n * When you click it, a link view (which lets you set the URL) is created and put on top of the toolbar view, so the link panel\n * is displayed. When you finish editing the link and close (remove) the link view, the toolbar view is visible again.\n *\n * However, there are cases when there are multiple independent balloons to be displayed, for instance, if the selection\n * is inside two inline comments at the same time. For such cases, you can create two independent panel stacks.\n * The contextual balloon plugin will create a navigation bar to let the users switch between these panel stacks using the \"Next\"\n * and \"Previous\" buttons.\n *\n * If there are no views in the current stack, the balloon panel will try to switch to the next stack. If there are no\n * panels in any stack, the balloon panel will be hidden.\n *\n * **Note**: To force the balloon panel to show only one view, even if there are other stacks, use the `singleViewMode=true` option\n * when {@link module:ui/panel/balloon/contextualballoon~ContextualBalloon#add adding} a view to a panel.\n *\n * From the implementation point of view, the contextual ballon plugin is reusing a single\n * {@link module:ui/panel/balloon/balloonpanelview~BalloonPanelView} instance to display multiple contextual balloon\n * panels in the editor. It also creates a special {@link module:ui/panel/balloon/contextualballoon~RotatorView rotator view},\n * used to manage multiple panel stacks. Rotator view is a child of the balloon panel view and the parent of the specific\n * view you want to display. If there is more than one panel stack to be displayed, the rotator view will add a\n * navigation bar. If there is only one stack, the rotator view is transparent (it does not add any UI elements).\n *\n * @extends module:core/plugin~Plugin\n */\nexport default class ContextualBalloon extends Plugin {\n\t/**\n\t * @inheritDoc\n\t */\n\tstatic get pluginName() {\n\t\treturn 'ContextualBalloon';\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * @inheritDoc\n\t */\n\tconstructor( editor ) {\n\t\tsuper( editor );\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * The {@link module:utils/dom/position~Options#limiter position limiter}\n\t\t * for the {@link #view balloon}, used when no `limiter` has been passed into {@link #add}\n\t\t * or {@link #updatePosition}.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * By default, a function that obtains the farthest DOM\n\t\t * {@link module:engine/view/rooteditableelement~RootEditableElement}\n\t\t * of the {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#selection}.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @member {module:utils/dom/position~Options#limiter} #positionLimiter\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis.positionLimiter = () => {\n\t\t\tconst view = this.editor.editing.view;\n\t\t\tconst viewDocument = view.document;\n\t\t\tconst editableElement = viewDocument.selection.editableElement;\n\n\t\t\tif ( editableElement ) {\n\t\t\t\treturn view.domConverter.mapViewToDom( editableElement.root );\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\treturn null;\n\t\t};\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * The currently visible view or `null` when there are no views in any stack.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @readonly\n\t\t * @observable\n\t\t * @member {module:ui/view~View|null} #visibleView\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis.set( 'visibleView', null );\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * The common balloon panel view.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @readonly\n\t\t * @member {module:ui/panel/balloon/balloonpanelview~BalloonPanelView} #view\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis.view = new BalloonPanelView( editor.locale );\n\t\teditor.ui.view.body.add( this.view );\n\t\teditor.ui.focusTracker.add( this.view.element );\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * The map of views and their stacks.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t * @type {Map.<module:ui/view~View,Set>}\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis._viewToStack = new Map();\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * The map of IDs and stacks.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t * @type {Map.<String,Set>}\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis._idToStack = new Map();\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * A total number of all stacks in the balloon.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t * @readonly\n\t\t * @observable\n\t\t * @member {Number} #_numberOfStacks\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis.set( '_numberOfStacks', 0 );\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * A flag that controls the single view mode.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t * @readonly\n\t\t * @observable\n\t\t * @member {Boolean} #_singleViewMode\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis.set( '_singleViewMode', false );\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Rotator view embedded in the contextual balloon.\n\t\t * Displays the currently visible view in the balloon and provides navigation for switching stacks.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t * @type {module:ui/panel/balloon/contextualballoon~RotatorView}\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis._rotatorView = this._createRotatorView();\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Displays fake panels under the balloon panel view when multiple stacks are added to the balloon.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t * @type {module:ui/view~View}\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis._fakePanelsView = this._createFakePanelsView();\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * @inheritDoc\n\t */\n\tdestroy() {\n\t\tsuper.destroy();\n\n\t\tthis.view.destroy();\n\t\tthis._rotatorView.destroy();\n\t\tthis._fakePanelsView.destroy();\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Returns `true` when the given view is in one of the stacks.

(WRONG ❌) If the #maxWidth is set when the toolbar is invisible, it won't affect item grouping (no DOMRects, no grouping).\n\t\t//    Then, when panelView.pin() is called, the position of the toolbar will be calculated for the old\n\t\t//    items grouping state, and when finally ResizeObserver kicks in (hey, the toolbar is visible now, right?)\n\t\t//    it will group/ungroup some items and the length of the toolbar will change. But since in RTL the toolbar\n\t\t//    is attached on the right side and the positioning uses CSS \"left\", it will result in the toolbar shifting\n\t\t//    to the left and being displayed in the wrong place.\n\t\t// 2. (WRONG ❌) If the panelView.pin() is called first and #maxWidth set next, then basically the story repeats. The balloon\n\t\t//    calculates the position for the old toolbar grouping state, then the toolbar re-groups items and because\n\t\t//    it is positioned using CSS \"left\" it will move.\n\t\t// 3. (RIGHT ✅) We show the panel first (the toolbar does re-grouping but it does not matter), then the #maxWidth\n\t\t//    is set allowing the toolbar to re-group again and finally panelView.pin() does the positioning when the\n\t\t//    items grouping state is stable and final.\n\t\t//\n\t\t// https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6449, https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6575\n\t\tthis.panelView.show();\n\t\tthis.toolbarView.maxWidth = this._getToolbarMaxWidth();\n\n\t\tthis.panelView.pin( {\n\t\t\ttarget: this.buttonView.element,\n\t\t\tlimiter: this.editor.ui.getEditableElement()\n\t\t} );\n\n\t\tif ( !wasVisible ) {\n\t\t\tthis.toolbarView.items.get( 0 ).focus();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Hides the {@link #toolbarView}.\n\t *\n\t * @private\n\t * @param {Boolean} [focusEditable=false] When `true`, the editable will be focused after hiding the panel.\n\t */\n\t_hidePanel( focusEditable ) {\n\t\tthis.panelView.isVisible = false;\n\n\t\tif ( focusEditable ) {\n\t\t\tthis.editor.editing.view.focus();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Attaches the {@link #buttonView} to the target block of content.\n\t *\n\t * @protected\n\t * @param {HTMLElement} targetElement Target element.\n\t */\n\t_attachButtonToElement( targetElement ) {\n\t\tconst contentStyles = window.getComputedStyle( targetElement );\n\n\t\tconst editableRect = new Rect( this.editor.ui.getEditableElement() );\n\t\tconst contentPaddingTop = parseInt( contentStyles.paddingTop, 10 );\n\t\t// When line height is not an integer then thread it as \"normal\".\n\t\t// MDN says that 'normal' == ~1.2 on desktop browsers.\n\t\tconst contentLineHeight = parseInt( contentStyles.lineHeight, 10 ) || parseInt( contentStyles.fontSize, 10 ) * 1.2;\n\n\t\tconst position = getOptimalPosition( {\n\t\t\telement: this.buttonView.element,\n\t\t\ttarget: targetElement,\n\t\t\tpositions: [\n\t\t\t\t( contentRect, buttonRect ) => {\n\t\t\t\t\tlet left;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( this.editor.locale.uiLanguageDirection === 'ltr' ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft = editableRect.left - buttonRect.width;\n\t\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft = editableRect.right;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttop: contentRect.top + contentPaddingTop + ( contentLineHeight - buttonRect.height ) / 2,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft\n\t\t\t\t\t};\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t} );\n\n\t\tthis.buttonView.top = position.top;\n\t\tthis.buttonView.left = position.left;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Gets the {@link #toolbarView} max-width, based on\n\t * editable width plus distance between farthest edge of the {@link #buttonView} and the editable.\n\t *\n\t * @private\n\t * @returns {String} maxWidth A maximum width that toolbar can have, in pixels.\n\t */\n\t_getToolbarMaxWidth() {\n\t\tconst editableElement = this.editor.ui.view.editable.element;\n\t\tconst editableRect = new Rect( editableElement );\n\t\tconst buttonRect = new Rect( this.buttonView.element );\n\t\tconst isRTL = this.editor.locale.uiLanguageDirection === 'rtl';\n\t\tconst offset = isRTL ?

We have `operationsA` and `operationsB` array, which we dynamically update as the transformation process goes.\n\t//\n\t// 2. We take next (or first) operation from `operationsA` and check from which operation `b` we need to start transforming it.\n\t// All original `operationsA` are set to be transformed starting from the first operation `b`.\n\t//\n\t// 3. We take operations from `operationsB`, one by one, starting from the correct one, and transform operation `a`\n\t// by operation `b` (and vice versa). We update `operationsA` and `operationsB` by replacing the original operations\n\t// with the transformation results.\n\t//\n\t// 4. If operation is broken into multiple operations, we save all the new operations in the place of the\n\t// original operation.\n\t//\n\t// 5. Additionally, if operation `a` was broken, for the \"new\" operation, we remember from which operation `b` it should\n\t// be transformed by.\n\t//\n\t// 6. We continue transforming \"current\" operation `a` until it is transformed by all `operationsB`. Then, go to 2.\n\t// unless the last operation `a` was transformed.\n\t//\n\t// The actual implementation of the above algorithm is slightly different, as only one loop (while) is used.\n\t// The difference is that we have \"current\" `a` operation to transform and we store the index of the next `b` operation\n\t// to transform by. Each loop operates on two indexes then: index pointing to currently processed `a` operation and\n\t// index pointing to next `b` operation. Each loop is just one `a * b` + `b * a` transformation. After each loop\n\t// operation `b` index is updated. If all `b` operations were visited for the current `a` operation, we change\n\t// current `a` operation index to the next one.\n\t//\n\n\t// For each operation `a`, keeps information what is the index in `operationsB` from which the transformation should start.\n\tconst nextTransformIndex = new WeakMap();\n\n\t// For all the original `operationsA`, set that they should be transformed starting from the first of `operationsB`.\n\tfor ( const op of operationsA ) {\n\t\tnextTransformIndex.set( op, 0 );\n\t}\n\n\t// Additional data that is used for some postprocessing after the main transformation process is done.\n\tconst data = {\n\t\tnextBaseVersionA: operationsA[ operationsA.length - 1 ].baseVersion + 1,\n\t\tnextBaseVersionB: operationsB[ operationsB.length - 1 ].baseVersion + 1,\n\t\toriginalOperationsACount: operationsA.length,\n\t\toriginalOperationsBCount: operationsB.length\n\t};\n\n\t// Index of currently transformed operation `a`.\n\tlet i = 0;\n\n\t// While not all `operationsA` are transformed...\n\twhile ( i < operationsA.length ) {\n\t\t// Get \"current\" operation `a`.\n\t\tconst opA = operationsA[ i ];\n\n\t\t// For the \"current\" operation `a`, get the index of the next operation `b` to transform by.\n\t\tconst indexB = nextTransformIndex.get( opA );\n\n\t\t// If operation `a` was already transformed by every operation `b`, change \"current\" operation `a` to the next one.\n\t\tif ( indexB == operationsB.length ) {\n\t\t\ti++;\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tconst opB = operationsB[ indexB ];\n\n\t\t// Transform `a` by `b` and `b` by `a`.\n\t\tconst newOpsA = transform( opA, opB, contextFactory.getContext( opA, opB, true ) );\n\t\tconst newOpsB = transform( opB, opA, contextFactory.getContext( opB, opA, false ) );\n\t\t// As a result we get one or more `newOpsA` and one or more `newOpsB` operations.\n\n\t\t// Update contextual information about operations.\n\t\tcontextFactory.updateRelation( opA, opB );\n\n\t\tcontextFactory.setOriginalOperations( newOpsA, opA );\n\t\tcontextFactory.setOriginalOperations( newOpsB, opB );\n\n\t\t// For new `a` operations, update their index of the next operation `b` to transform them by.\n\t\t//\n\t\t// This is needed even if there was only one result (`a` was not broken) because that information is used\n\t\t// at the beginning of this loop every time.\n\t\tfor ( const newOpA of newOpsA ) {\n\t\t\t// Acknowledge, that operation `b` also might be broken into multiple operations.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// This is why we raise `indexB` not just by 1.

A batch is saved instead of the operation because changes are undone batch-by-batch, not operation-by-operation\n * and a batch is seen as one undo step.\n *\n * After some changes happen to the document, the `History` and `UndoCommand` stack can be represented as follows:\n *\n *\t\t    History                            Undo stack\n *\t\t==============             ==================================\n *\t\t[operation A1]                         [batch A]\n *\t\t[operation B1]                         [batch B]\n *\t\t[operation B2]                         [batch C]\n *\t\t[operation C1]\n *\t\t[operation C2]\n *\t\t[operation B3]\n *\t\t[operation C3]\n *\n * Where operations starting with the same letter are from same batch.\n *\n * Undoing a batch means that a set of operations which will reverse the effects of that batch needs to be generated.\n * For example, if a batch added several letters, undoing the batch should remove them. It is important to apply undoing\n * operations in the reversed order, so if a batch has operation `X`, `Y`, `Z`, reversed operations `Zr`, `Yr` and `Xr`\n * need to be applied. Otherwise reversed operation `Xr` would operate on a wrong document state, because operation `X`\n * does not know that operations `Y` and `Z` happened.\n *\n * After operations from an undone batch got {@link module:engine/model/operation/operation~Operation#getReversed reversed},\n * one needs to make sure if they are ready to be applied. In the scenario above, operation `C3` is the last operation and `C3r`\n * bases on up-to-date document state, so it can be applied to the document.\n *\n *\t\t     History                             Undo stack\n *\t\t=================             ==================================\n *\t\t[ operation A1  ]                      [  batch A  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B1  ]                      [  batch B  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B2  ]             [   processing undoing batch C   ]\n *\t\t[ operation C1  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C2  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3r ]\n *\n * Next is operation `C2`, reversed to `C2r`. `C2r` bases on `C2`, so it bases on the wrong document state. It needs to be\n * transformed by operations from history that happened after it, so it \"knows\" about them. Let us assume that `C2' = C2r * B3 * C3 * C3r`,\n * where `*` means \"transformed by\". Rest of operations from that batch are processed in the same fashion.\n *\n *\t\t     History                             Undo stack                                      Redo stack\n *\t\t=================             ==================================             ==================================\n *\t\t[ operation A1  ]                      [  batch A  ]                                    [ batch Cr ]\n *\t\t[ operation B1  ]                      [  batch B  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B2  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C1  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C2  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3r ]\n *\t\t[ operation C2' ]\n *\t\t[ operation C1' ]\n *\n * Selective undo works on the same basis, however, instead of undoing the last batch in the undo stack, any batch can be undone.\n * The same algorithm applies: operations from a batch (i.e. `A1`) are reversed and then transformed by operations stored in history.\n *\n * Redo also is very similar to undo. It has its own stack that is filled with undoing (reversed batches). Operations from\n * batch that is re-done are reversed-back, transformed in proper order and applied to the document.\n *\n *\t\t     History                             Undo stack                                      Redo stack\n *\t\t=================             ==================================             ==================================\n *\t\t[ operation A1  ]                      [  batch A  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B1  ]                      [  batch B  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B2  ]                      [ batch Crr ]\n *\t\t[ operation C1  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C2  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3r ]\n *\t\t[ operation C2' ]\n *\t\t[ operation C1' ]\n *\t\t[ operation C1'r]\n *\t\t[ operation C2'r]\n *\t\t[ operation C3rr]\n *\n * @extends module:core/plugin~Plugin\n */\nexport default class Undo extends Plugin {\n\t/**\n\t * @inheritDoc\n\t */\n\tstatic get requires() {\n\t\treturn [ UndoEditing, UndoUI ];\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * @inheritDoc\n\t */\n\tstatic get pluginName() {\n\t\treturn 'Undo';\n\t}\n}\n","/**\n * @license Copyright (c) 2003-2021, CKSource - Frederico Knabben.
